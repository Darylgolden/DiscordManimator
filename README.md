# DiscordManimator

A Manim Rendering Bot for Discord. Requires a working `docker` environment: the `manimcommunity/manim:stable` image is used for rendering.


### Deploying the Bot

After obtaining a Discord bot token, make a new file called config.py in the same directory by copying config_example.py. Edit the new config.py and add your token. The bot is then started by running `python DiscordManimator.py`.
